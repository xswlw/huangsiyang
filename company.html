        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Our company</h3>
        <p>Ferdinand Porsche founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH" with Adolf Rosenberger and
            Anton Piëch in 1931. The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart. Initially, the
            company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting, but did not build any cars under its own
            name. One of the first assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car
            for the people; that is, a Volkswagen. This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful
            car designs of all time. The Porsche 64 was developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.


            Porsche's tank prototype, the "Porsche Tiger", that lost to Henschel & Son's Tiger I.

            Panzerjäger Elefant – after the loss of the contract to the Tiger I, Porsche recycled his design into a tank
            destroyer.
            During World War II, Volkswagen production turned to the military version of the Volkswagen Beetle, the
            Kübelwagen, 52,000 produced, and Schwimmwagen, 15,584 produced. Porsche produced several designs for heavy
            tanks during the war, losing out to Henschel & Son in both contracts that ultimately led to the Tiger I and
            the Tiger II. However, not all this work was wasted, as the chassis Porsche designed for the Tiger I was
            used as the base for the Elefant tank destroyer. Porsche also developed the Maus super-heavy tank in the
            closing stages of the war, producing two prototypes. Ferdinand Porsche's biographer, Fabian Müller,
            wrote that Porsche had thousands of people forcibly brought to work at their factories during the war. The
            workers wore the letter "P" on their clothing at all times. It stood not for "Porsche", but for "Poland."

            At the end of World War II in 1945, the Volkswagen factory at KdF-Stadt fell to the British. Ferdinand lost
            his position as chairman of the board of management of Volkswagen, and Ivan Hirst, a British Army major, was
            put in charge of the factory. (In Wolfsburg, the Volkswagen company magazine dubbed him "The British Major
            who saved Volkswagen".) On 15 December of that year, Ferdinand was arrested for war crimes, but not tried.
            During his 20-month imprisonment, Ferdinand Porsche's son, Ferry Porsche, decided to build his own car,
            because he could not find an existing one that he wanted to buy. He also had to steer the company through
            some of its most difficult days until his father's release in August 1947. The first models of what was
            to become the 356 were built in a small sawmill in Gmünd, Austria. The prototype car was shown to German
            auto dealers, and when pre-orders reached a set threshold, production (with aluminum body) was begun by
            Porsche Konstruktionen GesmbH, founded by Ferry and Louise. Many regard the 356 as the first Porsche simply
            because it was the first model sold by the fledgling company. After production of the 356 was taken over by
            the father's Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH in Stuttgart in 1950, Porsche commissioned a Zuffenhausen-based
            company, Reutter Karosserie, which had previously collaborated with the firm on Volkswagen Beetle
            prototypes, to produce the 356's steel body. In 1952, Porsche constructed an assembly plant (Werk 2) across
            the street from Reutter Karosserie; the main road in front of Werk 1, the oldest Porsche building, is now
            known as Porschestrasse. The 356 was road certified in 1948.

            <p>The company has always had a close relationship with, initially, the Volkswagen (VW) marque, and later,
                the Volkswagen Group (which also owns Audi AG), because the first Volkswagen Beetle was designed by
                Ferdinand Porsche.

                The two companies collaborated in 1969 to make the VW-Porsche 914 and 914-6, whereby the 914-6 had a
                Porsche engine, and the 914 had a Volkswagen engine. Further collaboration in 1976 resulted in the
                Porsche 912E (US only) and the Porsche 924, which used many Audi components, and was built at Audi's
                Neckarsulm factory, which had been NSU's. Porsche 944s were also built there, although they used far
                fewer Volkswagen components. The Cayenne, introduced in 2002, shares its chassis with the Volkswagen
                Touareg and the Audi Q7, which is built at the Volkswagen Group factory in Bratislava, Slovakia.

            <p>Porsche SE was created in June 2007 by renaming the old Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, and became a holding
                company for the families' stake in Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH (50.1%) (which in turn held 100% of the
                old Porsche AG) and Volkswagen AG (50.7%). At the same time, the new Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG
                (Porsche AG) was created for the car manufacturing business.

                In August 2009, Porsche SE and Volkswagen AG reached an agreement that the car manufacturing operations
                of the two companies would merge in 2011, to form an "Integrated Automotive Group". The
                management of Volkswagen AG agreed to 50.76% of Volkswagen AG being owned by Porsche SE in return for
                Volkswagen AG management taking Porsche SE management positions (in order for Volkswagen management to
                remain in control), and for Volkswagen AG acquiring ownership of Porsche AG.

                As of the end of 2015, the 52.2% control interest in VW AG is the predominant investment by Porsche SE,
                and Volkswagen AG in turn controls brands and companies such as Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT, Škoda, Bentley,
                Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche AG, Ducati, VW Commercial Vehicles, Scania, MAN, as well as Volkswagen
                Financial Services.

                Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG (which stands for Doktor Ingenieur honoris causa Ferdinand Porsche
                Aktiengesellschaft), as a 100% subsidiary of VW AG, is responsible for the actual production and
                manufacture of the Porsche automobile line. The company currently produces Porsche 911, Boxster and
                Cayman sports cars, the Cayenne and Macan sport utility vehicles and the four-door Panamera.</p>
